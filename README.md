# Robo Race

Robo Race is a game in development state. 
It is strongly inspired by [Robo Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboRally).
The current development state is playable at [Heroku](https://roborace.herokuapp.com).

### todo list:
  - rework how the svg is integrated into the html (zooming + panning like google maps, maybe copy&paste from nutria)
  - display the state of other players in the game board. ie. a green shadow for ready players, red shadow for not ready player
  - rework the lobby ...
  - do some research about rendering engines ...
